# Oprea: A Differential Geometry Library

This is a simple differential geometry library written in C and using OpenGL for visualizations of 2D and 3D curves and manifolds and their properties.
Used `Differential Geometry and its Applications` by John Oprea for reference and inspiration.

## Features

- Parametric curve plotting in 2D
- Calculation of geometric properties such as curvature and torsion
- Visualization of curves with color mapping based on curvature
- Simple OpenGL-based rendering

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- OpenGL and GLFW libraries
- GLEW library
